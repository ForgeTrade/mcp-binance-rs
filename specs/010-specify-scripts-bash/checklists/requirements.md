# Requirements Validation Checklist: Streamable HTTP Transport Cleanup

**Purpose**: Validate specification quality before proceeding to planning phase
**Created**: 2025-10-18
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

**Note**: This checklist validates that the specification follows best practices and contains all required information without implementation details.

## Content Quality

- [x] CQ001 No programming language names appear in spec (e.g., "Rust", "Python", "JavaScript")
- [x] CQ002 No framework or library names appear (e.g., "axum", "tokio", "React")
- [x] CQ003 No API implementation details (e.g., "HTTP handler", "database query")
- [x] CQ004 All user stories describe user goals, not technical implementation
- [x] CQ005 Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- [x] CQ006 No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain in the spec

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] RC001 All functional requirements are testable (can write test case)
- [x] RC002 Each requirement uses clear MUST/SHOULD language
- [x] RC003 Requirements avoid ambiguous terms like "fast", "simple", "good"
- [x] RC004 Edge cases are documented and have clear expected behavior
- [x] RC005 Key entities are defined with their properties
- [x] RC006 Dependencies on other systems are explicitly listed

## Feature Readiness

- [x] FR001 Each user story has Given/When/Then acceptance scenarios
- [x] FR002 User stories are prioritized (P1, P2, P3)
- [x] FR003 Each user story can be tested independently
- [x] FR004 Scope clearly defines what is IN scope vs OUT of scope
- [x] FR005 Assumptions are explicitly documented
- [x] FR006 Risks have mitigation strategies

## Architecture Clarity

- [x] AC001 System boundaries are clear (what changes, what doesn't)
- [x] AC002 Data flow is described in user terms (not implementation)
- [x] AC003 No mention of specific file names or code locations
- [x] AC004 Session management behavior is clear without technical details
- [x] AC005 Error scenarios describe user-visible behavior

## Specification Validation Summary

**Total Items**: 21
**Passed**: 21 ✅
**Failed**: 0 ❌

**Status**: ✅ READY FOR PLANNING PHASE

## Notes

- Specification successfully avoids all implementation details (Rust, axum, handlers)
- All user stories are independently testable with clear priorities
- Success criteria are measurable: "ChatGPT connects", "40% code reduction", "5-minute comprehension"
- Technology-agnostic language: "System MUST handle requests" vs "Axum handler processes HTTP POST"
- Clear scope boundaries prevent scope creep during implementation
- Edge cases documented with expected user-visible behavior

**Next Phase**: Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to create implementation plan with technical details
