# Specification Quality Checklist: MCP Enhancements Phase 1

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-17
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### ✅ Content Quality - PASS

- Specification focuses on WHAT users need (AI-guided trading analysis, efficient market data access) without mentioning HOW (rmcp macros, Rust implementations)
- User value clearly articulated: "enables natural language interaction with market data and AI-powered analysis"
- Business needs addressed: improved UX, reduced API calls, better error handling
- All mandatory sections present and complete

### ✅ Requirement Completeness - PASS

- Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers in specification
- All requirements testable (e.g., FR-002: "MUST provide a `trading_analysis` prompt" - can verify by calling prompt)
- Success criteria measurable (e.g., SC-001: "within 3 seconds", SC-003: "reduces tool call count by 40%")
- Success criteria technology-agnostic (focused on user-facing outcomes, not internal tech)
- 5 user stories with detailed acceptance scenarios (Given-When-Then format)
- 5 edge cases identified with expected behaviors
- Scope clearly bounded (Out of Scope section lists Phase 2-4 items)
- 10 assumptions and 3 dependency categories documented

### ✅ Feature Readiness - PASS

- All 24 functional requirements mapped to user stories:
  - FR-001 to FR-007: Support User Story 1 & 2 (Prompts)
  - FR-008 to FR-016: Support User Story 3 & 4 (Resources)
  - FR-017 to FR-024: Support User Story 5 (Error handling)
- User scenarios cover all primary flows:
  - Natural language trading analysis
  - Portfolio risk assessment
  - Resource-based data access
  - Error recovery guidance
- 8 measurable success criteria defined
- No implementation leakage detected

## Notes

- Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` phase
- All quality criteria met on first validation pass
- Feature is well-scoped with clear priorities (P1/P2/P3)
- Implementation can proceed incrementally (Phase 1a-1d breakdown provided)
- Strong foundation with 3 reference docs (counter example, MCP spec, IMPROVEMENTS.md)

## Recommendation

**STATUS**: ✅ **APPROVED FOR PLANNING**

Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation plan and tasks.
