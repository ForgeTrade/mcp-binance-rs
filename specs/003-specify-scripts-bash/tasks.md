# Tasks: HTTP REST API + WebSocket –¥–ª—è Binance

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/003-specify-scripts-bash/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ‚úÖ, spec.md ‚úÖ, research.md ‚úÖ

**Tests**: Not explicitly requested in specification - implementation only

**Organization**: Tasks grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1-US6)
- All paths relative to repository root

## Path Conventions
- Single Rust project: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- New HTTP module: `src/http/`
- Existing Binance client: `src/binance/`

## Terminology Mapping

**Spec ‚Üí Implementation**:
- "Bearer token" (spec.md) ‚Üí `TokenStore`, `validate_bearer_token()` (tasks.md, src/http/middleware/auth.rs)
- "WebSocket" (spec.md) ‚Üí `tokio-tungstenite`, `tokio::sync::broadcast` (tasks.md, src/http/websocket/)
- "Binance credentials" (spec.md) ‚Üí `BinanceClient`, `Credentials::from_env()` (existing from feature 001)

This ensures user-facing terminology (spec) maps clearly to developer implementation terms (tasks/code).

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup (Phase 1) - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phases 3-8)**: All depend on Foundational (Phase 2) completion
  - US1, US2, US3 (REST APIs) can proceed in parallel after Phase 2
  - US4, US5, US6 (WebSockets) can proceed in parallel after Phase 2
  - WebSocket stories may benefit from REST API completion but are independent
- **Polish (Phase 9)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1 - Market Data REST)**: Independent after Phase 2
- **User Story 2 (P1 - Orders REST)**: Independent after Phase 2
- **User Story 3 (P1 - Account REST)**: Independent after Phase 2 (may use same account endpoint as US2 but separate implementation)
- **User Story 4 (P2 - Ticker WebSocket)**: Independent after Phase 2, introduces WebSocket infrastructure
- **User Story 5 (P2 - Depth WebSocket)**: Can reuse WebSocket infrastructure from US4 but independent
- **User Story 6 (P2 - User Data WebSocket)**: Can reuse WebSocket infrastructure from US4, needs US3 listen key endpoint

### Within Each User Story

- Tasks marked [P] within a phase can run in parallel (different files)
- Sequential tasks build on each other (e.g., create module ‚Üí implement handlers ‚Üí register routes)
- WebSocket stories follow pattern: Binance client ‚Üí broadcast channel ‚Üí client handler ‚Üí route registration

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup)**: T002, T003, T004, T005 can run in parallel (different module files)

**Phase 2 (Foundational)**: T010, T011, T014, T015 can run in parallel (independent middleware/error handling)

**Phase 3 (US1 - Market Data)**: T017, T018, T019, T020, T021, T022 can run in parallel (independent handler functions in same file - use function stubs first)

**Phase 4 (US2 - Orders)**: T027, T028, T029, T030, T031, T032, T033, T034 can run in parallel (independent structs and handlers)

**Phase 5 (US3 - Account)**: T039, T040, T041, T042 can run in parallel (independent handlers)

**Phase 6 (US4 - Ticker WS)**: T047, T048, T049, T050, T052, T053 can run in parallel initially (Binance client + handler module creation)

**Phase 7 (US5 - Depth WS)**: T059, T060, T061, T062 can run in parallel (similar pattern to US4)

**Phase 8 (US6 - User Data WS)**: T069, T070, T071, T072, T073, T074 can run in parallel (similar pattern to US4/US5)

**Phase 9 (Polish)**: T081, T082, T083, T084, T085 can run in parallel (independent documentation files)

### Cross-Story Parallelization

After Phase 2 completion, teams can work on multiple stories simultaneously:

```
Team A: US1 (Market Data REST) - 10 tasks
Team B: US2 (Orders REST) - 12 tasks
Team C: US3 (Account REST) - 8 tasks
Team D: US4 (Ticker WebSocket) - 12 tasks

All 4 teams work in parallel, each delivers independently testable functionality
```

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (Market Data REST)

```bash
# Launch all handler implementations in parallel (function stubs in market_data.rs):
Task T018: "Implement GET /api/v1/ticker/price handler"
Task T019: "Implement GET /api/v1/ticker/24hr handler"
Task T020: "Implement GET /api/v1/klines handler"
Task T021: "Implement GET /api/v1/depth handler"
Task T022: "Implement GET /api/v1/trades handler"

# These can be implemented simultaneously as they're independent functions
# calling different methods on the same BinanceClient
```
