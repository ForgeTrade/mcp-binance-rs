# Feature Specification: SSE Transport for Cloud Deployment

**Feature Branch**: `009-specify-scripts-bash`
**Created**: 2025-10-18
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "SSE transport for Shuttle.dev cloud deployment with HTTPS access"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Remote MCP Access via HTTPS (Priority: P1)

AI assistants and applications need to access the Binance MCP server remotely over HTTPS from any location, not just from the local machine where the server runs.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition - enabling cloud deployment. Without this, the feature has no purpose. Currently, the server only works via stdio (local-only), which prevents cloud hosting and remote access.

**Independent Test**: Deploy server to Shuttle.dev and successfully connect Claude Desktop from a different machine using the HTTPS endpoint URL. Server responds to tool calls like `get_ticker` without requiring local installation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** server is deployed to Shuttle with HTTPS endpoint, **When** Claude Desktop connects using the HTTPS URL, **Then** connection succeeds and server lists all available tools
2. **Given** HTTPS connection is established, **When** user invokes `get_ticker("BTCUSDT")`, **Then** server returns current market data within 2 seconds
3. **Given** server is running on Shuttle, **When** multiple clients connect simultaneously, **Then** each client receives independent responses without interference

### User Story 2 - Seamless Shuttle Deployment (Priority: P2)

Developers need to deploy the MCP server to Shuttle.dev with minimal configuration, leveraging Shuttle's automatic HTTPS, secrets management, and zero-ops infrastructure.

**Why this priority**: Shuttle.dev is the target platform mentioned by the user. Easy deployment lowers the barrier to adoption and reduces operational overhead.

**Independent Test**: Run `shuttle deploy` from project root and verify that the server is accessible at the provided HTTPS URL without manual SSL certificate configuration or additional infrastructure setup.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** project has `Shuttle.toml` configured, **When** developer runs `shuttle deploy`, **Then** deployment completes successfully and returns a public HTTPS URL
2. **Given** server requires Binance API credentials, **When** developer stores secrets in Shuttle, **Then** server accesses credentials securely at runtime without exposing them in code
3. **Given** server is deployed, **When** developer runs `shuttle logs`, **Then** server logs display connection attempts, tool calls, and error messages

---

### User Story 3 - Dual Transport Support (Priority: P3)

Developers need both local (stdio) and remote (SSE) transport options available via feature flags, allowing local development with stdio and cloud deployment with SSE without code changes.

**Why this priority**: Maintaining stdio support ensures existing local workflows continue working while adding SSE as an optional capability. This prevents breaking changes for current users.

**Independent Test**: Build with `--features http-api` and verify stdio mode works locally. Build with `--features http-api,sse` and verify SSE endpoints respond to HTTP requests. Both modes should use the same tool implementations.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** server built without `sse` feature, **When** running locally with stdio transport, **Then** Claude Desktop connects via stdio and all tools function normally
2. **Given** server built with `sse` feature, **When** starting server, **Then** SSE endpoints (`/mcp/sse`, `/mcp/message`) are exposed and respond to HTTP POST requests
3. **Given** both transports are available, **When** switching between stdio and SSE, **Then** tool behavior remains identical (same inputs produce same outputs)

### Edge Cases

- What happens when SSE client disconnects mid-request (network failure)?
  - Server should cancel in-flight operations and clean up resources
  - Reconnection should establish a new session without state corruption

- How does system handle concurrent SSE connections from multiple clients?
  - Each SSE connection maintains independent session state
  - Rate limiting applies per-client to prevent abuse

- What happens when Shuttle restarts the service (deployment, scaling)?
  - Active SSE connections gracefully disconnect with appropriate error codes
  - Clients automatically reconnect using exponential backoff

- How does system handle Binance API key errors in SSE mode?
  - Return HTTP 503 (Service Unavailable) during SSE handshake if API keys invalid
  - Include error details in SSE error event for client debugging

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST support Server-Sent Events (SSE) transport protocol for MCP communication over HTTPS
- **FR-002**: System MUST expose two SSE endpoints: `/mcp/sse` for connection handshake and `/mcp/message` for JSON-RPC 2.0 message exchange
- **FR-003**: System MUST maintain backward compatibility with existing stdio transport when SSE feature is disabled
- **FR-004**: System MUST integrate with Shuttle.dev deployment platform via `Shuttle.toml` configuration
- **FR-005**: System MUST load Binance API credentials from Shuttle secrets store (environment variables) without hardcoding
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle SSE connection lifecycle (connect, message exchange, disconnect, reconnect)
- **FR-007**: System MUST support concurrent SSE connections from multiple clients with independent session state
- **FR-008**: System MUST implement graceful shutdown for SSE connections during server restarts
- **FR-009**: System MUST log all SSE connection events (connect, disconnect, errors) for monitoring and debugging
- **FR-010**: System MUST return appropriate HTTP status codes for SSE connection errors (401 Unauthorized, 503 Service Unavailable, etc.)
- **FR-011**: System MUST use existing Axum HTTP server infrastructure from `http-api` feature for SSE endpoints
- **FR-012**: System MUST reuse all existing MCP tool implementations without modification (get_ticker, get_orderbook_metrics, etc.)

### Key Entities

- **SSE Connection Session**: Represents an active SSE connection with a client, including connection ID, start time, last activity timestamp, and client metadata
- **MCP Message**: JSON-RPC 2.0 formatted message exchanged between client and server via SSE, containing method, params, id, and result/error fields
- **Shuttle Configuration**: Deployment metadata including project name, runtime settings, secret references, and health check endpoints

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Developers can deploy server to Shuttle.dev in under 5 minutes using `shuttle deploy` command
- **SC-002**: SSE endpoint responds to connection requests within 500ms under normal load (< 10 concurrent connections)
- **SC-003**: Server maintains 100% tool compatibility between stdio and SSE transports (same tools, same behavior)
- **SC-004**: Server handles at least 50 concurrent SSE connections without degradation in response time
- **SC-005**: Deployment process succeeds with zero manual SSL/HTTPS configuration required
- **SC-006**: Server reconnection after Shuttle restart completes within 10 seconds for all clients
- **SC-007**: 95% of tool calls via SSE transport complete successfully on first attempt (excluding Binance API errors)
