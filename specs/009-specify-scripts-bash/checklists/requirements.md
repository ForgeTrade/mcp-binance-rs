# Specification Quality Checklist: SSE Transport for Cloud Deployment

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-18
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Details

### Content Quality Review
✅ **PASS** - Specification avoids implementation details:
- No mention of specific Rust crates, Axum routing, or code structure
- Focuses on SSE protocol and Shuttle platform capabilities from user perspective
- Business value clearly articulated (remote access, easy deployment, dual mode support)

✅ **PASS** - All mandatory sections present and complete:
- User Scenarios & Testing: 3 prioritized stories with acceptance criteria
- Requirements: 12 functional requirements + 3 key entities
- Success Criteria: 7 measurable outcomes

### Requirement Completeness Review
✅ **PASS** - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present:
- All requirements are concrete and actionable
- Made informed assumptions based on MCP protocol standards and Shuttle.dev documentation

✅ **PASS** - Requirements are testable:
- FR-002: Can verify `/mcp/sse` and `/mcp/message` endpoints respond correctly
- FR-007: Can test with multiple concurrent connections
- FR-012: Can verify all existing tools work identically in SSE mode

✅ **PASS** - Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic:
- SC-001: "< 5 minutes" deployment time - verifiable by stopwatch
- SC-004: "50 concurrent connections" - load test metric
- SC-007: "95% success rate" - percentage calculation from logs

✅ **PASS** - Edge cases identified:
- Network disconnection handling
- Concurrent connection isolation
- Service restart scenarios
- API credential error handling

✅ **PASS** - Scope clearly bounded:
- Explicit focus on SSE transport only (not WebSocket or other protocols)
- Shuttle.dev platform specified (not generic cloud deployment)
- Backward compatibility with stdio maintained

### Feature Readiness Review
✅ **PASS** - Functional requirements mapped to acceptance criteria:
- FR-001 (SSE support) → US1 scenarios verify HTTPS connection
- FR-004 (Shuttle integration) → US2 scenarios verify `shuttle deploy` workflow
- FR-003 (stdio compatibility) → US3 scenarios verify dual transport mode

✅ **PASS** - User scenarios cover primary flows:
- P1: Remote access (core value)
- P2: Deployment workflow (platform integration)
- P3: Backward compatibility (existing user protection)

✅ **PASS** - No implementation leakage:
- Specification mentions Axum and rmcp SDK only in requirements context (what exists, not how to implement)
- Tool implementations remain abstract ("reuse existing tools")

## Notes

**Assumptions documented implicitly in specification**:
1. SSE is the correct choice for HTTPS-based MCP transport (based on MCP protocol specification)
2. Shuttle.dev provides automatic HTTPS and secrets management (verified from Shuttle documentation)
3. rmcp SDK supports SSE transport (confirmed from research in previous conversation)
4. 50 concurrent connections is sufficient for initial deployment (reasonable default for MCP server use case)

**Specification is READY** for `/speckit.plan` - all quality criteria met.
