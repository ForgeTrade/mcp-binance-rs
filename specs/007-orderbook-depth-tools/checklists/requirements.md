# Requirements Quality Checklist

## Specification: Order Book Depth Tools (007-orderbook-depth-tools)

### 1. User Scenarios Quality

- [x] **Prioritization**: User stories are clearly prioritized (P1-P3) based on value
  - P1: Quick Spread Assessment (core trading decision use case)
  - P2: Detailed Depth Analysis (advanced microstructure analysis)
  - P3: Service Health Monitoring (operational visibility)

- [x] **Independence**: Each user story can be developed, tested, and deployed independently
  - P1 delivers spread/liquidity checking without P2/P3
  - P2 delivers depth inspection without P1/P3
  - P3 delivers health monitoring without P1/P2

- [x] **Testability**: Clear acceptance scenarios with Given-When-Then format
  - All scenarios include concrete conditions, actions, and outcomes
  - Scenarios cover happy path and edge cases (e.g., WebSocket down)

- [x] **Value Clarity**: Each story explains why it has its priority level
  - Rationale provided for all three priorities
  - Token economy benefits highlighted for progressive disclosure

- [x] **Edge Cases**: Comprehensive coverage of boundary conditions and error scenarios
  - Symbol not found, WebSocket drops, snapshot fails
  - Cache staleness, empty cache, zero quantities
  - Extreme imbalances, insufficient data, liquidity exhaustion

### 2. Functional Requirements Quality

- [x] **Specificity**: Requirements use "MUST" with concrete, measurable criteria
  - All 20 FRs specify exact behavior (e.g., "P95 latency ≤200ms")
  - Formulas provided for calculations (spread, microprice, imbalance)

- [x] **Completeness**: All aspects of the feature are covered
  - Tool interfaces (FR-001 to FR-003)
  - Data format (FR-004, FR-017, FR-018)
  - Caching strategy (FR-005, FR-016)
  - Error handling (FR-011, FR-013)
  - Logging (FR-019, FR-020)

- [x] **Traceability**: Requirements map to user stories
  - FR-001, FR-006 to FR-010 → P1 (Quick Spread Assessment)
  - FR-002, FR-004, FR-015 → P2 (Detailed Depth Analysis)
  - FR-003 → P3 (Service Health Monitoring)
  - FR-005, FR-011 to FR-016, FR-019, FR-020 → Infrastructure

- [x] **Technology Independence**: Requirements avoid implementation details where appropriate
  - Focuses on "what" (metrics, latency targets) not "how" (specific libraries)
  - Exception: Technical choices justified by PRD (BTreeMap for sorting, rust_decimal for precision)

- [x] **Clarifications Resolved**: All [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers addressed
  - **None present** - all requirements are clear and unambiguous

### 3. Key Entities Quality

- [x] **Clarity**: Each entity has clear purpose and attributes
  - 6 entities defined: OrderBook, OrderBookMetrics, Wall, SlippageEstimate, OrderBookDepth, OrderBookHealth
  - All include key attributes and relationships

- [x] **Relationships**: Entity relationships are described
  - OrderBookMetrics computed from OrderBook
  - Wall contained in OrderBookMetrics.walls
  - SlippageEstimate contained in OrderBookMetrics.slippage_estimates

- [x] **Data Consistency**: Entity definitions align with functional requirements
  - OrderBook structure (FR-015: BTreeMap, FR-017: Decimal)
  - Timestamps (FR-018: milliseconds)
  - Scaling factors (FR-004: price_scale=100, qty_scale=100000)

### 4. Success Criteria Quality

- [x] **Measurability**: All criteria use quantifiable metrics
  - Latency targets (SC-001, SC-002: P95 ≤200ms/≤300ms)
  - Size reduction (SC-003: ≥35%)
  - Token economy (SC-004, SC-005: ≤15%, 35% reduction)
  - Accuracy (SC-008 to SC-011: specific thresholds)
  - Reliability (SC-006, SC-007: 99.9%, 99%)

- [x] **Achievability**: Criteria are realistic given requirements
  - Latency targets aligned with WebSocket architecture
  - Accuracy thresholds appropriate for financial calculations
  - Token reduction backed by compact integer format

- [x] **Alignment**: Success criteria map to functional requirements
  - SC-001 validates FR-001 (metrics tool latency)
  - SC-002 validates FR-002 (depth tool latency)
  - SC-003 validates FR-004 (compact format size reduction)
  - SC-008 to SC-011 validate FR-006 to FR-010 (calculation accuracy)

- [x] **Coverage**: All critical aspects have success criteria
  - Performance (SC-001, SC-002, SC-015)
  - Data quality (SC-008 to SC-012)
  - Token economy (SC-004, SC-005)
  - Reliability (SC-006, SC-007, SC-013, SC-014)
  - Size optimization (SC-003)

### 5. Overall Specification Quality

- [x] **Consistency**: No contradictions between sections
  - Tool names consistent (get_orderbook_metrics, get_orderbook_depth, get_orderbook_health)
  - Latency targets consistent across user stories and success criteria
  - Data formats consistent across requirements and entities

- [x] **Completeness**: All mandatory sections present and filled

## Summary

**Status**: ✅ **READY FOR NEXT PHASE**

**Strengths**:
1. Clear progressive disclosure strategy (L1→L2-lite→L2-full) optimizes token economy
2. Comprehensive technical requirements with specific formulas and thresholds
3. Independent, testable user stories with clear priorities
4. Detailed edge case coverage for production readiness
5. Measurable success criteria aligned with requirements

**Notes**:
