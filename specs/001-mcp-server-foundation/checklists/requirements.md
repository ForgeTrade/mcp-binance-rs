# Specification Quality Checklist: MCP Server Foundation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality
✅ **PASS** - Spec focuses on WHAT users need (MCP protocol integration, Binance connectivity, secure credential handling) without specifying HOW to implement (no mention of specific Rust patterns, file structures, or code organization beyond stating "rmcp crate" which is a requirement, not implementation detail).

✅ **PASS** - Focused on AI assistant user value: ability to connect, discover tools, execute Binance queries securely.

✅ **PASS** - Written in plain language accessible to product managers and stakeholders. No deep technical jargon.

✅ **PASS** - All mandatory sections present: User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria.

### Requirement Completeness
✅ **PASS** - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers in the spec. All decisions made with reasonable defaults.

✅ **PASS** - All requirements are testable:
- FR-001: Can verify MCP lifecycle by testing initialize → initialized flow
- FR-003: Can verify by checking env var loading behavior
- FR-005: Can verify by calling get_server_time and checking response
- etc.

✅ **PASS** - Success criteria are measurable with specific metrics:
- SC-001: "under 500 milliseconds" (measurable)
- SC-002: "within 100 milliseconds" (measurable)
- SC-004: "Zero sensitive data exposure" (measurable)
- SC-006: "successful integration with Claude Desktop" (verifiable)

✅ **PASS** - Success criteria are technology-agnostic:
- "AI assistants can initialize" (not "Rust server starts")
- "Server handles tool calls" (not "Tokio runtime processes requests")
- Focus on user-facing outcomes, not system internals

✅ **PASS** - All three user stories have detailed acceptance scenarios in Given/When/Then format.

✅ **PASS** - Edge cases comprehensively identified: rate limits, invalid input, disconnects, env var issues, initialization timing, naming conflicts.

✅ **PASS** - Scope clearly bounded with "Out of Scope" section listing 12 excluded features.

✅ **PASS** - Assumptions section lists 8 explicit assumptions. Dependencies (rmcp, Tokio) identified in requirements.

### Feature Readiness
✅ **PASS** - All 15 functional requirements map to acceptance scenarios in user stories:
- FR-001-002: User Story 1 (initialization)
- FR-005: User Story 2 (get_server_time)
- FR-003-004, FR-011: User Story 3 (credentials)
- FR-006-015: Support requirements covered by acceptance scenarios

✅ **PASS** - User scenarios cover all primary flows: initialization, tool discovery, tool execution, credential loading, error handling.

✅ **PASS** - All 8 success criteria are measurable and map to requirements:
- SC-001-002: Performance
- SC-003: Reliability
- SC-004: Security
- SC-005-006: Correctness & Compliance
- SC-007-008: Usability

✅ **PASS** - No implementation details in spec. References to "rmcp crate", "Tokio", "HMAC SHA256" are requirements (what to use), not implementation (how to structure code).

## Overall Assessment

**Status**: ✅ **READY FOR PLANNING**

All validation criteria pass. The specification is:
- Complete and unambiguous
- Testable and measurable
- Focused on user value
- Free of implementation details
- Ready for `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify` (if needed)

## Notes

- Spec defines a minimal but complete foundation for the MCP server
- All three user stories are P1 priority, which is appropriate for foundation work
- Security-First principle is well-reflected in user story 3 and multiple FRs
- MCP Protocol Compliance principle is reflected in user story 1 and FRs
- The get_server_time tool provides a simple but effective validation point
