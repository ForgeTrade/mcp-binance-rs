## User Story Coverage

- [x] CHK027 P1 User Story 2 covers security isolation
- [x] CHK028 P2 User Story 3 covers credential revocation
- [x] CHK029 P2 User Story 4 covers environment-specific behavior
- [x] CHK030 All user stories have testable acceptance criteria

## Dependencies and Scope

- [x] CHK031 Dependencies on Feature 010 (Streamable HTTP Transport) documented
- [x] CHK032 Dependencies on BinanceClient refactoring documented
- [x] CHK033 Dependencies on SessionManager extension documented
- [x] CHK034 Out of scope items clearly defined (6 items)
- [x] CHK035 No conflicting requirements identified

## Success Criteria Validation

- [x] CHK036 SC-001: 100% account/trading tools work with credentials configured
- [x] CHK037 SC-002: 0% credential leakage between sessions
- [x] CHK038 SC-003: 0% credential persistence to disk
- [x] CHK039 SC-004: Configuration completes within 100ms
- [x] CHK040 SC-005: Environment switch takes effect within 1 API call
- [x] CHK041 SC-006: Fast-fail for unconfigured credentials (<50ms)

## Edge Case Coverage

- [x] CHK042 Invalid API key format handling (validation error)
- [x] CHK043 Invalid API secret format handling (validation error)
- [x] CHK044 Network failure during validation (accept without validation)
- [x] CHK045 Session expiry mid-request (credentials cleared immediately)
- [x] CHK046 Concurrent credential configuration (last write wins)
- [x] CHK047 Memory pressure with many sessions (max 50 session limit)
- [x] CHK048 Malformed environment value (validation error)
- [x] CHK049 Revoke during active request (in-flight completes, subsequent fail)
- [x] CHK050 Public tools without credentials (continue working)
- [x] CHK051 Rate limit exceeded (Binance error returned to user)

## Technical Clarity

- [x] CHK052 Session isolation mechanism specified (Mcp-Session-Id)
- [x] CHK053 Environment endpoints documented (testnet vs mainnet URLs)
- [x] CHK054 Credential validation format specified (64 chars alphanumeric)
- [x] CHK055 Response format for credential status specified
- [x] CHK056 Error messages for missing credentials specified
- [x] CHK057 Rate limiting rules specified (1200/6000 req/min)

## Quality Standards

- [x] CHK058 No implementation details in specification
- [x] CHK059 All requirements are testable
- [x] CHK060 Priorities align with user value (P1 for core blocker)
