## Assumptions Quality

- [x] **Explicit dependencies** - Assumes WebSocket <100ms latency, sufficient for order flow
- [x] **Testable assumptions** - Volume profile uses trades (verifiable), quote stuffing threshold calibrated for crypto (adjustable)
- [x] **Risk mitigation** - Notes iceberg detection assumes market maker behavior (1-3x median vs 5x+)
- [x] **Scope clarity** - Assumes spot markets initially, flags futures as different
- [x] **User knowledge** - Assumes trader familiarity with microstructure concepts

---

## Dependencies Clarity

- [x] **Feature 007 dependency** - Clearly requires existing WebSocket orderbook infrastructure
- [x] **External API dependency** - Needs Binance Trade Stream API (distinct from orderbook)
- [x] **New infrastructure** - Identifies need for time-series storage (not currently implemented)
- [x] **Library dependency** - Requires statistical analysis library (percentiles, rolling averages, std dev)

---

## Scope Boundaries

### In Scope
- [x] **Complete list** - Real-time order flow, volume profile (1h/4h/24h), 3 anomaly types, liquidity vacuums, absorption events, health scoring
- [x] **Achievable** - All items align with Binance WebSocket + trade data capabilities

### Out of Scope
- [x] **Clear exclusions** - Historical backtesting engine, automated trading, cross-exchange, ML-based detection, visualization, futures microstructure
- [x] **Justifications** - Each exclusion has rationale (e.g., "analytics only, no trading automation")

---

## Constitution Compliance

- [x] **Security-First** - No new authentication requirements (uses existing connection)
- [x] **Auto-Generation Priority** - Flags as manual implementation (no code generation)
- [x] **Modular Architecture** - New feature gate `orderbook_analytics` separate from base `orderbook`
- [x] **Type Safety** - All metrics use strong typing with validation
- [x] **MCP Protocol Compliance** - New tools follow existing JSON Schema patterns
- [x] **Async-First Design** - All calculations async, non-blocking on WebSocket thread
- [x] **Machine-Optimized Development** - Follows `/speckit.specify` workflow with testable requirements

## Overall Quality Assessment

### Strengths
✅ **User-centric design** - All requirements driven by trader/risk manager needs
✅ **Measurable outcomes** - Every success criterion is quantifiable and verifiable
✅ **Independent testing** - Each user story can be validated without full system integration
✅ **Clear priorities** - P1 (Order Flow) → P2 (Volume Profile) → P3 (Anomaly Detection) reflects business value
✅ **Technology-agnostic** - No implementation details, focuses on "what" not "how"
✅ **Comprehensive coverage** - 10 functional requirements, 8 success criteria, 4 edge cases
✅ **Realistic scope** - Builds on existing Feature 007 infrastructure

### Potential Improvements (Optional)
⚠️ **Time-series storage** - Dependency on "not currently implemented" storage could delay Feature 008
⚠️ **Historical data** - Volume profile (24h) requires storing completed trades, may need data retention policy
⚠️ **Anomaly thresholds** - Quote stuffing (500 updates/sec), iceberg (5x median) may need per-symbol tuning

---

## Final Verdict

**Status**: ✅ **READY FOR PLANNING PHASE**

**Reasoning**:
- All mandatory sections complete and high-quality
- Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- All requirements are testable, measurable, and technology-agnostic
- Success criteria are quantifiable and verifiable
- Dependencies clearly identified (Feature 007 + time-series storage)
- Scope boundaries well-defined

**Next Step**: Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation plan and design artifacts

**Checklist Summary**: 47/47 criteria passed (100%)
