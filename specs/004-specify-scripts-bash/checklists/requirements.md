# Specification Quality Checklist: Comprehensive Test Suite

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED - All checklist items validated

**Details**:

1. **Content Quality**: Specification focuses on testing outcomes (REST API correctness, WebSocket reliability, authentication security) without specifying test frameworks, languages, or tooling. Written from developer perspective needing confidence before production deployment.

2. **Requirement Completeness**: All 15 functional requirements (FR-001 to FR-015) are testable and unambiguous. No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all decisions made with reasonable defaults (Testnet API, shorter timeouts for tests, standard test patterns).

3. **Success Criteria**: All 10 success criteria (SC-001 to SC-010) are measurable with specific metrics:
   - SC-001: 100% success rate quantifiable
   - SC-003: 200ms latency measurable
   - SC-005: 500ms median response time measurable
   - SC-007: 5-minute test duration measurable
   - SC-010: 80% test coverage measurable

4. **Feature Readiness**: Five prioritized user stories cover complete testing scope:
   - US1 (P1): REST API testing - independently testable
   - US2 (P1): WebSocket testing - independently testable
   - US3 (P1): Authentication security - independently testable
   - US4 (P2): Error handling - independently testable
   - US5 (P3): Performance testing - independently testable

5. **Assumptions Documented**: Six clear assumptions about test execution environment (Testnet API, dedicated infrastructure, reduced timeouts, minimal balances).

**Recommendations**: Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` phase. No updates needed.

## Notes

- Feature focused on quality assurance and developer confidence
- All test scenarios technology-agnostic (can be implemented with any test framework)
- Clear separation between what to test (spec) vs how to test (implementation)
- Measurable outcomes enable objective validation of feature completion
