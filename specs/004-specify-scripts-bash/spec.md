# Feature Specification: Comprehensive Test Suite

**Feature Branch**: `004-specify-scripts-bash`
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Add comprehensive test suite with integration tests for all REST endpoints and WebSocket streams"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-16

- Q: Should tests use Production Binance API or Testnet? → A: Binance Testnet API exclusively
- Q: Should tests run sequentially or in parallel? → A: Parallel execution with explicit sequential markers for conflicting tests

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Verify REST API Correctness (Priority: P1)

Developers need confidence that all REST API endpoints work correctly and handle errors appropriately before deploying to production. The test suite should validate all 15 REST endpoints against expected behavior, including success cases, error cases, and edge conditions.

**Why this priority**: REST API endpoints are the primary interface for external systems. Any bugs in production could cause financial losses or incorrect trading decisions. Automated tests catch regressions before they reach users.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running the REST API test suite in isolation, which validates all market data, order management, and account endpoints without requiring WebSocket functionality.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the server is running with valid credentials, **When** a developer runs REST API tests, **Then** all endpoints return correct responses matching Binance API contracts
2. **Given** invalid authentication tokens are used, **When** REST endpoints are called, **Then** tests verify proper 401 Unauthorized responses
3. **Given** rate limits are exceeded, **When** multiple requests are made rapidly, **Then** tests confirm 429 Too Many Requests responses with Retry-After headers
4. **Given** invalid parameters are provided, **When** endpoints are called with bad data, **Then** tests verify 400 Bad Request responses with descriptive error messages
5. **Given** Binance API returns errors, **When** endpoints forward these errors, **Then** tests confirm proper error propagation and status code mapping

### User Story 2 - Validate WebSocket Stream Reliability (Priority: P1)

Developers need assurance that WebSocket streams correctly forward real-time data from Binance and handle connection failures gracefully. Tests should verify ticker updates, order book depth streams, and user data streams deliver accurate data with proper reconnection logic.

**Why this priority**: WebSocket streams provide real-time trading data. Connection drops or message loss could cause stale data, missed order updates, or incorrect balance information, leading to trading errors.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running WebSocket integration tests that connect to streams, verify message formats, simulate connection failures, and confirm automatic reconnection works correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a WebSocket connection is established, **When** ticker stream is subscribed, **Then** tests verify price updates arrive within 1 second and match expected JSON schema
2. **Given** depth stream is active, **When** order book updates occur, **Then** tests confirm bid/ask updates maintain proper sequence numbers and ordering
3. **Given** user data stream is active, **When** orders are placed/filled, **Then** tests verify executionReport and balanceUpdate events arrive correctly
4. **Given** WebSocket connection drops, **When** network fails temporarily, **Then** tests confirm automatic reconnection restores stream within 30 seconds
5. **Given** multiple concurrent WebSocket connections exist, **When** connection limit (50) is reached, **Then** tests verify new connections are rejected with appropriate error messages

### User Story 3 - Ensure Authentication Security (Priority: P1)

Developers need verification that authentication mechanisms prevent unauthorized access and properly handle credential validation. Tests should confirm bearer token validation, API key signature verification, and secure credential management work correctly.

**Why this priority**: Authentication failures could expose trading APIs to unauthorized access, enabling malicious actors to place orders or access sensitive account data. Security tests are critical for production readiness.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running security-focused integration tests that attempt various authentication scenarios, including valid tokens, expired tokens, missing credentials, and tampered signatures.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** valid bearer tokens are configured, **When** HTTP requests include correct Authorization headers, **Then** tests verify requests succeed with 200/201 responses
2. **Given** missing or invalid bearer tokens, **When** protected endpoints are called, **Then** tests confirm 401 Unauthorized responses prevent access
3. **Given** API credentials are loaded from environment, **When** authenticated Binance requests are made, **Then** tests verify HMAC SHA256 signatures are correctly generated
4. **Given** credentials are missing, **When** authenticated endpoints require them, **Then** tests confirm graceful error handling with clear messages
5. **Given** secrets are present in code, **When** security audit runs, **Then** tests verify no API keys or tokens appear in logs or error messages

---

### User Story 4 - Validate Error Handling (Priority: P2)

Developers need confidence that the system handles errors gracefully and provides actionable error messages. Tests should cover network failures, Binance API errors, malformed requests, and timeout scenarios.

**Why this priority**: Poor error handling leads to cryptic failures that are hard to debug. Clear, tested error paths reduce troubleshooting time and improve developer experience.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running error scenario tests that inject failures (network timeouts, invalid responses, rate limit errors) and verify the system responds appropriately.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Binance API returns 503 Service Unavailable, **When** endpoints proxy this error, **Then** tests verify 504 Gateway Timeout is returned to clients
2. **Given** network requests timeout, **When** API calls exceed timeout threshold (10 seconds), **Then** tests confirm timeout errors are returned within expected time
3. **Given** malformed JSON is sent to endpoints, **When** deserialization fails, **Then** tests verify 400 Bad Request with validation error details
4. **Given** concurrent request limits are exceeded, **When** semaphore capacity is full, **Then** tests confirm requests are queued or rejected appropriately
5. **Given** WebSocket messages are malformed, **When** Binance sends invalid JSON, **Then** tests verify connections remain stable and errors are logged

---

### User Story 5 - Performance and Load Testing (Priority: P3)

Developers need validation that the system meets performance requirements under load. Tests should measure response times, throughput, memory usage, and behavior under concurrent connections.

**Why this priority**: Performance issues often surface only under load. Proactive load testing identifies bottlenecks before they impact production users.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running performance benchmarks that simulate high load (1000 concurrent requests, 50 WebSocket connections) and verify response times and resource usage stay within acceptable limits.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the server is idle, **When** 1000 concurrent REST requests are sent, **Then** tests verify median response time stays under 500ms
2. **Given** 50 concurrent WebSocket connections are active, **When** price updates are broadcast, **Then** tests confirm all clients receive updates within 200ms
3. **Given** rate limiting is active, **When** 100 requests/minute threshold is approached, **Then** tests verify requests are throttled without dropped connections
4. **Given** long-running WebSocket streams exist, **When** connections remain open for 1 hour, **Then** tests verify memory usage stays stable (no leaks)
5. **Given** the server is under load, **When** graceful shutdown is initiated, **Then** tests confirm all connections close cleanly within 10 seconds

### Edge Cases

- What happens when Binance API changes response schemas unexpectedly?
- How does the system handle partial WebSocket message delivery (fragmented frames)?
- What occurs when bearer tokens are rotated while connections are active?
- How are duplicate WebSocket subscriptions handled for the same symbol?
- What happens when system clock skew causes timestamp validation failures?
- How does rate limiting behave across multiple clients with the same bearer token?
- What occurs when environment variables contain leading/trailing whitespace?
- How are invalid UTF-8 sequences in JSON responses handled?
- What happens when WebSocket connections exceed maximum frame size limits?
- How does the system recover when Redis (if used for rate limiting) becomes unavailable?

## Assumptions

- All integration tests target Binance Testnet API exclusively for safe, isolated testing without financial risk
- Performance benchmarks assume dedicated test infrastructure (not shared CI runners)
- WebSocket tests may use shorter timeouts (5-10 seconds) instead of production values (30+ seconds) for faster test execution
- Rate limiting tests will use reduced limits (10 requests/minute) to speed up test execution
- Mock responses will be based on current Binance API v3 schemas as of October 2025
- Tests execute in parallel by default to meet 5-minute completion target; only rate limiting, connection limit, and performance tests require sequential execution to avoid interference
